### write_hello.py

A simple Python script that writes 'Hello' (or custom messages) to a text file.

**Usage:**
```python
from write_hello import write_hello_to_file

# Write default "Hello" to hello.txt
write_hello_to_file()

# Write custom message to custom file
write_hello_to_file("my_file.txt", "Custom message")
```

**Run directly:**
```bash
python write_hello.py
```

This will create a file named `hello.txt` with the content "Hello".
